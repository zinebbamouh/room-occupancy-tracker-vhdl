# room-occupancy-tracker-vhdl
Hardware design project showcasing VHDL, FPGA synthesis, and verification skills. Tracks room occupancy, enforces maximum capacity, and integrates test-driven development practices.

The project implements a digital occupancy room tracker using VHDL. 

All the files can be found respecting the proper paths as shown below.

The commands needed to simulate with ModelSim can be also found below. 


/code/ : The folder containing all design and simulation
  /code/work/ : The ModelSim working library generated by  vlib work for VHDL compilation
  /code/occupency_room.vhd/ : The main VHDL source file containing the VHDL code
  /code/occupency_room.xdc/ : The Constraint file for the Xilinix Vivado implementation	
  /code/tb_occupency_room.vhd/ : The VHDL testbench used to simulate the VHDL code

end of the /code/ folder

/files/ : The folder containing the designs
  /files/Elaborated_Design.pdf/ : Contains the elaborated design generated by Vivado since the picture on the report is too small
  /files/Implemented_Design.pdf/ : Contains the implemented design generated by Vivado since the picture on the report is too small

end of the /files/folder


Command for running the ModelSim simulation with the tb_occupency_room.vhd testbench on the occupency_room.vhd source code.
It's important to open the terminal in the directory containing all the codes.

source /CMC/ENVIRONMENT/modelsim.env
vcom occupency_room.vhd
vcom tb_occupency_room.vhd
vsim work.tb_occupency_room
