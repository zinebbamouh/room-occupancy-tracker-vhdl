# Room Occupancy Tracker (VHDL)

Hardware design project showcasing **VHDL**, **FPGA synthesis**, and **verification skills**.  
The system tracks room occupancy, enforces a maximum capacity, and integrates test-driven development practices.

---

## Overview
This project implements a digital room occupancy tracker using VHDL.  
All source files, constraints, testbenches, and design exports are organized into the folders described below.

---

## Project Structure

### `/code/`
Contains all design and simulation files.
- `occupancy_room.vhd` — Main VHDL source file  
- `tb_occupancy_room.vhd` — Testbench for simulation  
- `occupancy_room.xdc` — Constraint file for Xilinx Vivado implementation  
- `work/` — ModelSim working library generated by `vlib work`  

### `/files/`
Contains Vivado design outputs.
- `Elaborated_Design.pdf` — Elaborated design generated by Vivado (clearer than report snapshot)  
- `Implemented_Design.pdf` — Implemented design generated by Vivado (clearer than report snapshot)

## Simulation (ModelSim)

Run the following commands from the `/code/` directory:

```bash
source /CMC/ENVIRONMENT/modelsim.env
vcom occupancy_room.vhd
vcom tb_occupancy_room.vhd
vsim work.tb_occupancy_room
